# tensorflow-serving-benchmark
I couldn't find any benchmarks of [TensorFlow Serving](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving)
and wanted to know the throughput of the native gRPC client compared to a REST-based
client that forwards requests to the a gRPC client (which most people are likely
to use for external-facing services).

Updated to run with TF 2.3.
